TOPIC
Records: basic concepts

EXAMPLE
Declaring a record

A record groups different data fields into a single structure.
Each field can have a different data type.
Records are used to represent real-world entities.

END_DESCRIPTION

type
    tPerson = record
        name: string;
        age: integer;
    end record
end type

algorithm example1
var
    p: tPerson;
end var
end algorithm

END_PSEUDOCODE

typedef struct {
    char name[25];
    int age;
} tPerson;

int main() {
    tPerson p;
    return 0;
}

END_C

EXAMPLE
Accessing record fields

Fields of a record are accessed using the dot operator.
Each field can be read or written independently.

END_DESCRIPTION

p.name := "Alice";
p.age := 30;

END_PSEUDOCODE

strcpy(p.name, "Alice");
p.age = 30;

END_C

EXAMPLE
Copying records

In pseudocode, records can be copied directly.
In C, each field must be copied manually.

END_DESCRIPTION

p2 := p1;

END_PSEUDOCODE

strcpy(p2.name, p1.name);
p2.age = p1.age;

END_C

TOPIC
Records containing arrays

EXAMPLE
Record with an array field

A record can contain arrays as fields.
This allows storing multiple related values.

END_DESCRIPTION

type
    tSubject = record
        name: string;
        marks: vector[5] of integer;
    end record
end type

END_PSEUDOCODE

typedef struct {
    char name[25];
    int marks[5];
} tSubject;

END_C

EXAMPLE
Accessing array elements in a record

Array elements inside a record are accessed using index notation.

END_DESCRIPTION

subject.marks[1] := 8;

END_PSEUDOCODE

subject.marks[0] = 8;

END_C

EXAMPLE
Traversing an array inside a record

Loops can be used to process array fields inside records.

END_DESCRIPTION

i := 1;
while i <= 5 do
    writeInteger(subject.marks[i]);
    i := i + 1;
end while

END_PSEUDOCODE

for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("%d\n", subject.marks[i]);
}

END_C

END_TOPIC


TOPIC
Nested records

EXAMPLE
Record containing another record

A record field can itself be another record.
This allows hierarchical data structures.

END_DESCRIPTION

type
    tDate = record
        day: integer;
        month: integer;
        year: integer;
    end record

    tPerson = record
        name: string;
        birth: tDate;
    end record
end type

END_PSEUDOCODE

typedef struct {
    int day;
    int month;
    int year;
} tDate;

typedef struct {
    char name[25];
    tDate birth;
} tPerson;

END_C

EXAMPLE
Accessing nested record fields

Nested fields are accessed using multiple dot operators.

END_DESCRIPTION

person.birth.year := 2000;

END_PSEUDOCODE

person.birth.year = 2000;

END_C

EXAMPLE
Using nested records in algorithms

Nested records help organize complex data clearly.

END_DESCRIPTION

writeInteger(person.birth.day);

END_PSEUDOCODE

printf("%d", person.birth.day);

END_C
